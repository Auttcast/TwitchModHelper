# TwitchModHelper

## Use-case:
As a channel moderator I want to see a notification when a new chatter (not a first-time chatter) is detected (per *session*) so that I may greet the chatter with a warm welcome.

## Ubiquitous Language:
*Session* is simply an instance of the application. All data is in-memory.

## Setup
npm install -g typescript
npm install

## Run
npx ts-node .\main.ts
